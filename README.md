Task 8
Create a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image to perform image restoration on a grayscale image provided by the user. The program should:

Allow the user to upload an image during runtime.

Simulate various types of image degradation, such as Gaussian noise, Salt & Pepper noise, and motion blur.

Apply suitable restoration techniques like Wiener filtering and Median filtering to recover the degraded images.

Calculate the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) for each restoration approach and compare the results.

Display the original, degraded, and restored images in a side-by-side layout and provide an analysis of which restoration method works best for each type of noise.
